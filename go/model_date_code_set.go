 * Shareholder Disclosure Hub API
 *
 * # About  Broadridge developed the Shareholder Disclosure Hub (SDH) to assist banks and other intermediaries with their compliance obligations with respect to the shareholder identification regulations made law in the 2017 amendment to the Shareholder Rights Directive (SRD II). SRD II allows issuers or issuer agents to submit a disclosure request to the chain of intermediaries at any time throughout the year at their chosen frequency. On behalf of Hub-participating intermediaries the Hub validates/authenticates these requests, provides the necessary request data to the Hub participant’s system, receives and validates the required response data, forwards the request to the Hub participant’s underlying intermediary clients and files the full response with the issuer or issuer agent.  The SDH API is built on the `Open API 3.0.3` specification. **[[LINK](https://swagger.io/specification/)]**  ## API Versioning --- The API is versioned using the Semantic versioning 2.0.0 (semver) specification. **[[LINK](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)]**  The versioning format is `major.minor.path`. The `major.minor` portion of the semver (e.g. 2.0.0, 2.1.0) shall designate a change in the feature. `\".patch\"` versions addresses errors if any in the document/SDH API.  ## API Technical Specifications --- The API provides the following services:  - **API Authentication:** The SDH API requires Bearer HTTP authentication. Every request **must** contain an `Authorization` header using the username and password associated with a user account existing in SDH.    Format of the authorization header:    ```   Authorization: Bearer <token>    Example:   Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.smRPmkC6TeZmUnwlrEjexEKHCehzS8qBC8mbIJOOJe0=   ```   The token is valid for `14400 seconds` i.e. `4 hours` from the date and time of its generation.  - **Disclosure requests:** This API endpoint enables the fetching of shareholder disclosure requests which are in `OPEN` and `PENDING` state.   This request must be accompanied by the JWT generated by the `API Authentication` endpoint, as mentioned above.  - **Disclosure response:** This section provides a set of endpoints for uploading a disclosure response.    - **Upload token:** A request for file upload must be accompanied by a CSRF token in the header of the request.       To generate a CSRF token for a file containing the disclosure response, an MD5 checksum of the file (in hex format), along with the name of the file       is to be provided in the request. This request must be accompanied by the JWT generated by the `API Authentication` endpoint, as mentioned above.    - **File upload:** Upload a file containing response to a disclosure request.     - The file should be of `JSON` format and should have the following naming convention **disclosureResponseIdentification_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.json**.       - `disclosureResponseIdentification`: value of the disclosureResponseIdentification field in the response.       - `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`: The date and time in UTC timezone in the said format.       For e.g. 4c582ed0eb3c01cb671000014d93738f_20200403103044.json     - The structure of the response is defined under `DisclosureResponse` schema.     - The file upload request must be accompanied by the CSRF and the authentication tokens.    - **File Processing status:** This API endpoint enables the fetching the statuses of disclosure responses uploaded.    **Note:** The SDH API currently doesn't support processing of bulk responses. Therefore only one response per file upload is allowed for processing.
